The Open3D frontend exposes a set of carefully selected data structures and algorithms in both C++ and Python. The backend is highly optimized and is set up for parallelization. Open3D was developed from a clean slate with a small and carefully considered set of dependencies. It can be set up on different platforms and compiled from source with minimal effort. The code is clean, consistently styled, and maintained via a clear code review mechanism. Open3D has been used in a number of published research projects and is actively deployed in the cloud. We welcome contributions from the open-source community.},

	abstract = {Separating point clouds into ground and non-ground measurements is an essential step to generate digital terrain models ({DTMs}) from airborne {LiDAR} (light detection and ranging) data. However, most filtering algorithms need to carefully set up a number of complicated parameters to achieve high accuracy. In this paper, we present a new filtering method which only needs a few easy-to-set integer and Boolean parameters. Within the proposed approach, a {LiDAR} point cloud is inverted, and then a rigid cloth is used to cover the inverted surface. By analyzing the interactions between the cloth nodes and the corresponding {LiDAR} points, the locations of the cloth nodes can be determined to generate an approximation of the ground surface. Finally, the ground points can be extracted from the {LiDAR} point cloud by comparing the original {LiDAR} points and the generated surface. Benchmark datasets provided by {ISPRS} (International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing) working Group {III}/3 are used to validate the proposed filtering method, and the experimental results yield an average total error of 4.58\%, which is comparable with most of the state-of-the-art filtering algorithms. The proposed easy-to-use filtering method may help the users without much experience to use {LiDAR} data and related technology in their own applications more easily.},

    abstract = {We present a robust framework for extracting lines of curvature from point clouds. First, we show a novel approach to denoising the input point cloud using robust statistical estimates of surface normal and curvature which automatically rejects outliers and corrects points by energy minimization. Then the lines of curvature are constructed on the point cloud with controllable density. Our approach is applicable to surfaces of arbitrary genus, with or without boundaries, and is statistically robust to noise and outliers while preserving sharp surface features. We show our approach to be effective over a range of synthetic and real-world input datasets with varying amounts of noise and outliers. The extraction of curvature information can benefit many applications in CAD, computer vision and graphics for point cloud shape analysis, recognition and segmentation. Here, we show the possibility of using the lines of curvature for feature-preserving mesh construction directly from noisy point clouds.}

We take the spherical image, which is transformed from the 3D {LiDAR} point clouds, as input of the convolutional neural networks ({CNNs}) to predict the point-wise semantic map. To make {PointSeg} applicable on a mobile system, we build the model based on the light-weight network, {SqueezeNet}, with several improvements. It maintains a good balance between memory cost and prediction performance. Our model is trained on spherical images and label masks projected from the {KITTI} 3D object detection dataset. Experiments show that {PointSeg} can achieve competitive accuracy with 90fps on a single {GPU} 1080ti. which makes it quite compatible for autonomous driving applications.},
