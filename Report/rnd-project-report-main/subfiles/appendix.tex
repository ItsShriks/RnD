\section*{Appendix}
\label{sec:appendix}

To improve the quality of writing in this report, I utilized several AI-assisted tools for grammar correction, punctuation, and overall fluency enhancement. Specifically:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{ChatGPT (OpenAI):} Used to reduce grammatical errors, enhance fluency, and improve sentence structure. 
    Prompts:
    
    \textbf{Prompts used:} "Make this grammatically correct and improve as per academic writing."
    
    \item \textbf{Grammarly:} Employed as a secondary grammar and punctuation checker.
    
    \item \textbf{DeepL Write:} Used to refine grammar and tone in selected paragraphs.
\end{itemize}

These tools assisted in improving the readability and professionalism of the final document without altering the core technical content or findings.
